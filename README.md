## ***American Airlines Project: Data-Driven Fare Optimization***

This project, completed as part of my capstone for a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Analytics at Columbia University, focuses on creating a systematic, data-driven framework for fare optimization. By integrating internal revenue data with external factors such as travel patterns, advanced purchase days, and holiday indicators, I engineered critical features like cumulative bookings and segmented advanced purchase days. Using **K-means clustering**, I segmented customers based on purchase behaviors and fare sensitivities to develop tailored fare ladders, improving pricing strategies and revenue outcomes. The project provided actionable insights and scalable recommendations, demonstrating the power of data analytics in transforming traditional pricing models.
